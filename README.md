# Twitch Search Sample

> Nuxt.js project

I have chosen [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) for this project since it combines [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org), and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) in a nice little framework. It also has Server Side Rendering built in as well without all the boilerplate, hot reloading on save, and webpack.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev # Or yarn run dev
```

Now go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the default search or try searching for [Starcraft](http://localhost:3000/?query=starcraft) in the launched site.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
